# Automate Finance with Python, Pandas, Streamlit and Plotpy

This projects aim to showcase your bank transactions in a very efficent and productive way\
For this I have used a dummy data which is given in the folder as .csv file.\
Here we will catch the category for a prticular product which will then be used automatically when that product will be called.\
First install Stramlit, Numpy, Pandas, Plotly\

The app will be run by Streamlit. It keeps the python scripts running all the time\
From Terminal write streamlit run xyz.py (the main file)\
It will run on 8501 port\
With streamlit, we will make the project look good and productive\

Important lines are commented in the code.\
**This is an one of a kind project with streamlit. Just had a great fun doing it.**
